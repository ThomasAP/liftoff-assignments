My app aims to aid in identifying affordable food items that follow criteria of user-created diet/nutrition plan. User can create and define their own nutrition plans, add foods to their plans, and later query database by price, food name, nutrition plan, etc. to quickly and easily find something to eat that fits their needs.

User will also be able to set a food budget at the beginning of the month in order to calculate a daily/weekly food budget. When user is over or under budget for a given month, the difference will be added/subtracted to/from the next month's budget.
